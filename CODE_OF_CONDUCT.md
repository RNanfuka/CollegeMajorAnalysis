# Adult Income Prediction – Team Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This Code of Conduct exists to support a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment for our team. We wrote it to clarify the values we want to uphold and to give us a simple way to address concerns if they arise. It reflects our commitment to treating each other with fairness and care as we work together on this project. As a team, we pledge to follow this Code and continue improving it as we work and grow together.

# Our  Standards

Examples of behavior that supports a positive environment include:

* Communicating respectfully and listening actively
* Asking questions without judgment
* Giving and receiving feedback kindly and constructively.
* Taking responsibility for your actions and correcting mistakes promptly
* Celebrating team progress and appreciating others’ contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Harassment, discrimination, or exclusion in any form
* Mocking, belittling, or making disrespectful comments
* Altering, deleting, or blocking access to teammates’ work without agreement
* Ignoring concerns, withholding important information, or blocking participation
* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness behaviour that goes against this Code, you have several options for raising the concern.
* Speaking directly to the person involved, if you feel safe doing so
* Reaching out to another teammate you trust
* Contacting the instructor or TA for support
* Documenting the situation including dates, messages, or screenshots if it helps bring clarity

No retaliation:

No one should ever be treated negatively for asking questions or raising concerns in good faith.

## Enforcement 

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour can be brought forward by emailing Alan at alnliu11@student.ubc.ca or by contacting the TA or instructor. Any concern raised will be reviewed and handled in a way that is fair, respectful, and appropriate to the situation. We will maintain confidentiality whenever possible and approach each report with care and discretion. If a team member does not follow or uphold this Code in good faith, steps may be taken to address the issue, which may include discussions, adjustments to responsibilities, or escalation to the course team.

Our aim is always to restore a safe and collaborative working environment.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces connected to our project, whether we are collaborating online, meeting in person, or taking part in any activity where we represent the team. This includes GitHub contributions, group chats, shared documents, study sessions, presentations, and any project-related communication on or offline. Team members are expected to uphold these standards whenever their words or actions reflect on the project or its community.

## Our Responsibilities

As teammates working together on this project, we share the responsibility of making our expectations clear and stepping in when behaviour doesn’t align with this Code. We aim to handle concerns fairly and respectfully, and to make decisions that keep our working environment positive and comfortable for everyone.

We may also need to review, edit, or ask for changes to contributions whether it’s code, comments, documents, or other project work if they don’t follow the standards in this Code. In some cases, participation may be limited when someone’s actions are disruptive or harmful. These decisions are made thoughtfully and with the goal of protecting the team and the quality of the project.

## Updates and Continuous Improvement

We see this Code of Conduct as something that can grow with us. As our project develops, we may notice areas that need more clarity or changes that could better support how we work together. We’re open to adjusting or improving this Code whenever it helps strengthen communication, fairness, or the overall team experience. Everyone is welcome to suggest updates or raise ideas for making it better.
