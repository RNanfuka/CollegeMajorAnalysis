# Adult Income Prediction

This project explores the Adult Income dataset to understand how demographic and work-related factors relate to earning more or less than **$50,000 per year**. It provides a fully reproducible **Make + Docker + Quarto** workflow for data preparation, validation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and report rendering.

## Requirements

On your machine:
- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)
- (Optional) Make

Inside the container:
- Python environment and dependencies defined in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml)
- Quarto (installed in the image / Conda environment)

All Python dependencies are declared in **[`environment.yml`](environment.yml)** and are installed during the Docker build to ensure full reproducibility.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> AdultIncomePrediction
cd AdultIncomePrediction


# 3) Start the container
make up
# or:
# docker-compose up -d

# 4) Run the full analysis pipeline and render the report
docker exec -it 522-milestone bash -lc 'eval "$(/opt/conda/bin/conda shell.bash hook)" && conda activate 522-milestone && make all'
```

After `make all` completes, the rendered report will be available at: <http://localhost:8889/>

Note: If you are running it for the first time, the Docker pull and the hyperparameter tuning may take some time.

Alternatively, you can try running it on your local machine without Docker.

```bash
# 1) Create the conda environment from the lock file
make env

# 2) Activate the environment 
conda activate 522-milestone

# 3) Run the full analysis pipeline and render the report
make all

# 4) Run quarto preview to view the report locally
quarto preview --port 8889 --host 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

After `make all` completes, the rendered report will be available at: <http://localhost:8889/>

## How to run individual steps in detail

### Build the image

```bash
make build
```

This builds the Docker image defined in `Dockerfile`, installing all dependencies from
[`environment.yml`](environment.yml).

Rebuild only if:

* `Dockerfile` changes
* `environment.yml` changes

---

### Start and stop the container

```bash
make up
make stop
```

---

### Run commands inside the container

All analysis and reporting commands are intended to run **inside the container**.

Open an interactive shell:

```bash
docker exec -it 522-milestone bash
````

Then activate the Conda environment:

```bash
conda activate 522-milestone
```

Run a single command directly:

```bash
docker exec -it 522-milestone bash -lc "<command>"
```

Examples:

```bash
docker exec -it 522-milestone bash -lc "make help"
docker exec -it 522-milestone bash -lc "make analysis"
docker exec -it 522-milestone bash -lc "make report"
```

Exit the container shell with `exit` or `Ctrl+D`.

---

## Make targets (what to run)

### Full pipeline + report

```bash
make all
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
make data validate split preprocess eda model report
```

---

### Analysis only (Python pipeline, no Quarto)

```bash
make analysis
```

This runs:

1. Download and clean raw data
2. Validate cleaned data
3. Split data into train/test
4. Run EDA and generate figures
5. Preprocess features
6. Train models with hyperparameter tuning
7. Generate tables and plots

---

### Individual steps

Download and clean data:

```bash
make data
```

Validate cleaned data (non-failing):

```bash
make validate
```

Split into train/test:

```bash
make split
```

Preprocess train and test data:

```bash
make preprocess
```

Run EDA:

```bash
make eda
```

Train models and generate artifacts:

```bash
make model
```

Render the Quarto report/site:

```bash
make report
```

---

## Outputs

### Data

* Raw data: `data/raw/adult.csv`
* Cleaned data: `data/processed/clean_adult.csv`
* Train/test split: `data/processed/train.csv`, `data/processed/test.csv`
* Preprocessed data:

  * `data/processed/preprocessed_train.csv`
  * `data/processed/preprocessed_test.csv`

### EDA figures

Saved to:

```text
artifacts/figures/
```

### Modeling artifacts

Saved to:

```text
artifacts/tables/
artifacts/figures/
```

Includes:

* Cross-validation summaries
* Model coefficients
* Hyperparameter search results
* Performance plots and table images

### Report

* Rendered output: `docs/index.html`

---

## Quarto notes

The Quarto source file is:

```text
reports/income-prediction.qmd
```

Rendering inside the container can be done with:

```bash
quarto render
```

The report expects all analysis artifacts (EDA + modeling outputs) to exist before rendering.

---

## Cleaning up

Remove processed data and figures (keeps directory structure):

```bash
make clean
```

Stop and remove containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Container not found**

* Ensure it is running: `docker ps`
* Start it: `make up`

**Quarto not found inside container**

* Ensure Quarto is listed in [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) and rebuild the image

**Report missing plots or tables**

* Run the analysis first:

```bash
make analysis
make report
```

or simply:

```bash
make all
```
