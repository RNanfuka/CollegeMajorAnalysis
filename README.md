# Adult Income Prediction

## Introduction
This project uses the Adult Income dataset to explore general patterns in income inequality. Our aim is to understand, at a high level, how personal and work-related characteristics relate to income categories and to build a clear, reproducible starting point for further analysis.

## Project overview

This project examines the Adult Income dataset to understand how demographic and socioeconomic factors influence whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 per year. By analyzing variables such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, work hours, and race, the project uncovers broad patterns in income distribution and highlights which characteristics are most strongly associated with higher earnings. The goal is to provide a clear, high-level perspective on income inequality across different demographic groups while building a reproducible and transparent foundation for further data exploration and modeling.

## How to run the analysis
1. Clone the repository and move into it: `git clone <repo-url> && cd AdultIncomePrediction`.
2. Build the Conda environment defined in `environment.yml`: `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate adult-income-prediction`.
4. Launch Jupyter Lab from the project root: `jupyter lab`.
5. Open or create your analysis notebook (e.g., `reports/income-prediction.ipynb`), point it to `data/adult.csv`, and execute the cells to reproduce the charts and summary metrics.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.12+
- pandas
- jupyterlab
- See `environment.yml` for the authoritative set of packages and versions used in the project.
