# Adult Income Prediction

This project explores the Adult Income dataset to understand how demographic and work-related factors relate to earning more or less than \$50,000 per year. It includes a reproducible pipeline for data prep, modeling, and a Quarto report.

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)
- Make (optional, for shortcuts)
- Quarto inside the container for rendering (see setup below)

## Getting started
1) Clone and enter the repo
```bash
git clone <repo-url> IncomePrediction
cd IncomePrediction
```

2) Build the image
```bash
make build        # or: docker compose build
```

3) Start the container (JupyterLab on host port 8878)
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
- Check logs for the Jupyter token: `docker compose logs -f 522-milestone`
- Open the printed URL but swap the port to `8878` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8878/?token=...`).
- Adjust the port in `docker-compose.yml` if you need a different host port.

4) In JupyterLab, open a Terminal (from the “+ Launcher” or File → New → Terminal) and activate the env
```bash
eval "$(/opt/conda/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
conda activate 522-milestone

```

5) Run the pipeline from that JupyterLab terminal  
**All steps at once:**
```bash
make run-all-py
```
This downloads data, cleans/splits it, runs validations/EDA, trains models (with HPO), and regenerates artifacts.

**Or run steps individually:**
- Download raw data: `make download-data`
- Clean data: `make clean-data`
- Validate cleaned data: `make data-validate`
- Train/test split: `make split-data`
- Exploratory analysis figs: `make eda`
- Feature preprocessing (train/test): `make preprocess-data`
- Hyperparameter search + model training: `make model-train`
- Reuse tuned models to regenerate outputs (skip HPO): `make model-reuse`

What each step produces (paths):
- Raw data: `data/raw/` (downloaded from UCI)
- Cleaned + split CSVs: `data/processed/clean_adult.csv`, `data/processed/train.csv`, `data/processed/test.csv`
- Validation report/logs: printed to terminal from `make data-validate` (non-blocking)
- EDA figures: `artifacts/figures/`
- Preprocessed train/test matrices: `data/processed/train_preprocessed.parquet`, `data/processed/test_preprocessed.parquet`
- Models, metrics, and tuning artifacts: `artifacts/` (tables, pickles, plots)

## Quarto report
Quarto must be available inside the container (install with `mamba install -n 522-milestone -c conda-forge quarto` if missing).

Use the JupyterLab terminal (with the env activated) to render:
```bash
quarto render reports/income-prediction.qmd
```
Preview (inside the container):
```bash
quarto preview reports/income-prediction.qmd --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8889
```
Then open `http://localhost:8889` in your browser (add `- "8889:8889"` to `docker-compose.yml` if the port is not already mapped).
Notes:
- If you want Quarto baked into the image, add `quarto` to `environment.yml`, regenerate locks, and rebuild.
- Preview uses an extra port; if you prefer not to expose it, render to HTML only.

## Clean up
- Stop services: `docker compose down`
- Remove stopped containers: `docker compose rm`

## Troubleshooting
- Jupyter URL/port mismatch: check `docker-compose.yml` port mapping and use that host port in the URL token.
- Conda not found in JupyterLab terminal: run `eval "$(/opt/conda/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"` before `conda activate 522-milestone`.
- Quarto not found: install in the container env (`mamba install -n 522-milestone -c conda-forge quarto`) or rebuild with it baked in.
- Stale artifacts: remove `data/processed/` and `artifacts/` if you need a clean run, then rerun the pipeline.
